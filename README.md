This feedback should help you improve your skills.

‚õîÔ∏è The feedback uses Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct to compare your response to a gold standard solution. As we know, LLMs are not perfect. You should compare your work against the assessment criteria if you doubt the feedback.

Here's your detailed feedback:### Question 1: Create a Basic Code Agent with Web Search Capability

Your Solution:

# Create a CodeAgent with DuckDuckGo search capability
from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],  # Add search tool here
    model=HfApiModel,  # Add model here
)
Reference Solution:

from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],
    model=HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")
)
Assessment Criteria:
Correct imports are included
DuckDuckGoSearchTool is added to tools list
HfApiModel is properly configured
Model ID is correctly specified
Feedback:
Overall Assessment
The student's solution is mostly correct but has a few issues that need to be addressed to fully meet the assessment criteria.

Correct imports are included
‚úÖ The student correctly imported the necessary modules from the smolagents package.

DuckDuckGoSearchTool is added to tools list
‚úÖ The student correctly added the DuckDuckGoSearchTool to the tools list.

HfApiModel is properly configured
‚ùå The student did not properly configure the HfApiModel. The model should be instantiated with the model ID as an argument, not just the class name.

Model ID is correctly specified
‚ùå The student did not specify the model ID when instantiating the HfApiModel. The correct model ID 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct' should be passed as an argument to the HfApiModel constructor.

Question 2: Set Up a Multi-Agent System with Manager and Web Search Agents
Your Solution:

from smolagents import CodeAgent, ToolCallingAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

# Create web agent and manager agent structure
web_agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],  # Add required tools
    model=HfApiModel(),  # Add model
    max_steps=5,  # Adjust steps
    name="searchGoogl",  # Add name
    description="Searches the web for items",  # Add description
)

manager_agent = CodeAgent(web_agent)
Reference Solution:

web_agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), visit_webpage],
    model=model,
    max_steps=10,
    name="search",
    description="Runs web searches for you."
)

manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    managed_agents=[web_agent],
    additional_authorized_imports=["time", "numpy", "pandas"]
)
Assessment Criteria:
Web agent has correct tools configured
Manager agent properly references web agent
Appropriate max_steps value is set
Required imports are authorized
Feedback:
Overall Assessment
The student's solution is mostly correct but has some issues that need to be addressed.

Web agent has correct tools configured
‚ùå The web agent is missing the 'visit_webpage' tool, which is required according to the reference solution.

Manager agent properly references web agent
‚ùå The manager agent is not properly initialized. It should be initialized with the 'managed_agents' parameter set to a list containing the web agent, and it should also include the 'additional_authorized_imports' parameter.

Appropriate max_steps value is set
‚ùå The max_steps value of 5 is lower than the reference solution's 10. While it may be appropriate, it is not the same as the reference solution.

Required imports are authorized
‚ùå The student's solution does not include the 'time', 'numpy', and 'pandas' imports, which are required according to the reference solution.

Question 3: Configure Agent Security Settings
Your Solution:

# Set up secure code execution environment
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel
import datetime

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=HfApiModel(),
    additional_authorized_exports=["datetime"],  # Add security configuration
)
Reference Solution:

from smolagents import CodeAgent, E2BSandbox

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    sandbox=E2BSandbox(),
    additional_authorized_imports=["numpy"]
)
Assessment Criteria:
E2B sandbox is properly configured
Authorized imports are appropriately limited
Security settings are correctly implemented
Basic agent configuration is maintained
Feedback:
Overall Assessment
The student's solution has some issues that need to be addressed to meet the assessment criteria.

E2B sandbox is properly configured
‚ùå The student used HfApiModel instead of E2BSandbox for the sandbox parameter. This does not meet the requirement of using E2BSandbox.

Authorized imports are appropriately limited
‚ùå The student used 'additional_authorized_exports' instead of 'additional_authorized_imports'. This is incorrect as the requirement is to limit authorized imports, not exports.

Security settings are correctly implemented
‚ùå The security settings are not correctly implemented due to the issues mentioned above.

Basic agent configuration is maintained
‚ùå The basic agent configuration is not fully maintained due to the incorrect use of the sandbox and the incorrect parameter for authorized imports.

Question 4: Implement a Tool-Calling Agent
Your Solution:

# Create a tool-calling agent
from smolagents import ToolCallingAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

agent = ToolCallingAgent(tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()], model=HfApiModel())
Reference Solution:

from smolagents import ToolCallingAgent

agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[custom_tool],
    model=model,
    max_steps=5,
    name="tool_agent",
    description="Executes specific tools based on input"
)
Assessment Criteria:
Tools are properly configured
Step limit is set appropriately
Agent name and description are provided
Basic configuration is complete
Feedback:
Unable to generate detailed feedback due to an error.

Question 5: Set Up Model Integration
Your Solution:

# Configure model integration
from smolagents import HfApiModel, ToolCallingAgent, HfApiModel

model = ToolCallingagent(tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()], model=HfApiModel())
Reference Solution:

from smolagents import HfApiModel, LiteLLMModel

# Hugging Face model
hf_model = HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")

# Alternative model via LiteLLM
other_model = LiteLLMModel("anthropic/claude-3-sonnet")
Assessment Criteria:
Correct model imports are included
Model is properly initialized
Model ID is correctly specified
Alternative model option is provided
Feedback:
Overall Assessment
The student's solution does not meet the assessment criteria. The correct model imports are not included, the model is not properly initialized, the model ID is not specified, and an alternative model option is not provided.

Correct model imports are included
‚ùå The student's solution includes an incorrect import statement for ToolCallingagent and HfApiModel is imported twice.

Model is properly initialized
‚ùå The student's solution does not properly initialize the model. The HfApiModel is initialized without a model ID, and the ToolCallingagent is not properly initialized with the required parameters.

Model ID is correctly specified
‚ùå The student's solution does not specify a model ID for the HfApiModel.

Alternative model option is provided
‚ùå The student's solution does not provide an alternative model option using LiteLLMModel

    model=model,
    max_steps=10,
    name="search",
    description="Runs web searches for you."

manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    managed_agents=[web_agent],
    additional_authorized_imports=["time", "numpy", "pandas"]

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    sandbox=E2BSandbox(),
    additional_authorized_imports=["numpy"]

```


##### Solution IV: Implement a Tool-Calling Agent

from smolagents import ToolCallingAgent, custom_tool, HfApiModel

agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[custom_tool],
    model=HfApiModel(),
    max_steps=5,
    name="tool_agent",
    description="Executes specific tools based on input"
)
```


##### Solution V: Set Up Model Integration
```python
from smolagents import HfApiModel, LiteLLMModel

# Hugging Face model
hf_model = HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")

# Alternative model via LiteLLM
other_model = LiteLLMModel("anthropic/claude-3-sonnet")
